    def lc_2138(self,string,k):
    
        '''
        A string s can be partitioned into groups of size k using the following procedure:
        The first group consists of the first k characters of the string, the second group consists of 
        the next k characters of the string,and so on. Each character can be a part of exactly one group.
        For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group.
        Note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character from the last group (if it exists) 
        and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be s.
        Given the string s, the size of each group k and the character fill, return a string array denoting 
        the composition of every group s has been divided into, using the above procedure.
 
        EXAMPLE:
        Input: s = "abcdefghi", k = 3, fill = "x"
        Output: ["abc","def","ghi"]
        Explanation:
        The first 3 characters "abc" form the first group.
        The next 3 characters "def" form the second group.
        The last 3 characters "ghi" form the third group.
        Since all groups can be completely filled by characters from the string, we do not need to use fill.
        Thus, the groups formed are "abc", "def", and "ghi".

        You are given a string s consisting of digits and an integer k.
        A round can be completed if the length of s is greater than k. In one round, do the following:
        Divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are in the first group,
        the next k characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.
        Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits.
        For example, "346" is replaced with "13" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.
        Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than k,
        repeat from step 1.Return s after all rounds have been completed.

        EXAMPLE:
        Input: s = "11111222223", k = 3
        Output: "135"
        Explanation: 
        - For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: "111", "112", "222", and "23".
          ​​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. 
          So, s becomes "3" + "4" + "6" + "5" = "3465" after the first round.
        - For the second round, we divide s into "346" and "5".
          Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. 
          So, s becomes "13" + "5" = "135" after second round. 
        Now, s.length <= k, so we return "135" as the answer.
